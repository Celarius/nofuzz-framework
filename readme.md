Nofuzz is a nano-framework that enables rapid development of REST API applications in PHP.

Designed to be PSR compliant, very small and lightweight, but still have enough muscle to power complex API's.

Nofuzz is built around a Routing engine and the Controller principle. Built in are features such as Caches, multiple Database drivers and a myriad of other often needed features in API's (like JWT).
